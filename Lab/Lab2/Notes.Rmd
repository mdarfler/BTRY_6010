## Box Plot

`boxplot(data)`

- The box is defined by $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$ with the bar in the middle representing the median. The whiskers are the "extremes" of the data with outliers shown as circles.

- Upper whisker is at most $Q_{3} + 1.5 \times IQR$ (inter quartile range, i.e. the distance between the 1st and third quartile)

- Invented by Tukey

```{r}
dat = read.table("titanic(4).txt", header=1)

boxplot(dat$Age)
```
